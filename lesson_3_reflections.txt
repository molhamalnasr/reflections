When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you have multiple contributors to the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because other contributors could be making changes to files that would impact what I am working on.  I would rather choose when I want to be "impacted" and deal with any merge issues, etc.  This is analagous to choosing when I want to "update" a program or an operating system. I know that when I go to update a program or OS, there could be negative issues that arise from the update.  So rather than it automatically updating, I choose when I'm ready to deal with the updates.
